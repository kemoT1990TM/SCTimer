# SCTimer
Desktop Speedcubing Timer in Java.
Using WCA Scramble Generator.
Calculation of avarages is working as expected.
Added options: Storing data in txt file, Resetting session, Showing times and scrambles for best averages dialog.
Used thread binding.
Several corrections will be implemented soon: label adjusting to 6x6 and 7x7 scrambles needs to be corrected in a first place.
Storing averages in DB and times in files will be added later.
